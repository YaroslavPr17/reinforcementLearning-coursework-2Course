# Reinforcement-Learning_Coursework - 2-course
Current work investigates basic concepts of reinforcement learning. These ideas were implemented to simulate city-traffic and cars behaviour within the particular city-map. 

Instead of using deep-learning approach, this algorithm included so-called transition-states, which generalized others so that agent was able to make decisions in unvisited layouts.

### To be implemented:
* Neural nets, providing model with non-linear connections between agent's actions and decisions it makes.
* Profound city structure, that includes lights, road-signs and other real-world attributes.
* Multi-agent interaction.
* Numerous city-layouts to learn at.
